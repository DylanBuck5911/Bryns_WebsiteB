		<p id="bio">My name is Miles Enright, im a graphics designer and digital artist and have over 15 years experience working in software such as Blender, Cinema4D, Maya and zBrush. When i was 16 i picked up my first copy of Blender, it was very limited compared to the capabilities it has today, but i took a liking to it and slowly developed and worked on my skills over the years. This website is a platform for me to showcase all my work over the years and create digital footprint in the graphic design industry.</p>
